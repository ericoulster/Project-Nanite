Github requires a folder to have a file within it in order for that folder to be uploaded.

This folder is referenced within the code, and so it must contain a file.

As a result, this is a load-bearing text file.

We probably could have programmed it so that the python files generate the folder on start-up.

But this seemed slightly more efficient.

Thank you for listening to our story. 

I hope you are having a nice day.
