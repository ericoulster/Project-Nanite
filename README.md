# Project-Nanite
A productivity tool focused on word-counts and analytics

This project is currently under development.

Project Nanite is an open-source tool designed to help you track and analyze your progress made when writing large projects.

It is designed to help you keep forward momentum through visual analytics, gamification and additional info about your writing habits.

At the time of writing (2021-12-12), we have a worked build released, though are still in the progress of overhauling documentation (including here)
